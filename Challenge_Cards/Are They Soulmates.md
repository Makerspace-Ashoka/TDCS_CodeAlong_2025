## Are They Soulmates?

### Difficulty Level: Medium

### Instructions
You are given names of two people (your function inputs). Your task is to determine if their relationship is “magical.” A magical bond exists if the string formed by combining both names (ignoring spaces and cases- account for these using appropriate python functions) reads the same forwards and backwards.
**Example**:
 Input: "Anna" and "N a n a" → Output: “Magical!”
 ("annanana" reversed is the same)
