## Digital Biometrics

### Difficulty Level: Easy

### Instructions
What is biometric data? What forms of it do you use every day without realizing?
Where is your data going — stored locally on device, or uploaded to a server?
What’s the biggest risk if biometric data is leaked? (Hint: you can change your password, but not your face.)
Look into one real-world incident (e.g., Aadhaar biometric leak, Clearview AI, etc.) and write a 2–3 line summary of what happened.
