## RSA Encryption

### Difficulty Level: Hard

### Instructions
**Task A**: Write an algorithm that performs an RSA encryption of a message. Clearly state the invariants. (How should one go about decrpyting the message?)

**Task B**: You have been given a message that is RSA encrypted. Write an algorithm that breaks it. Clearly state the invariants. (What did you observe?)

**Task C**: How does an RSA differ from Diffie Hellman algorithm, or other algorithms, you learned in class?
