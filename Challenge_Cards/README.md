## Challenge Cards
**Finding the class content too easy? Pick up a challenge card, and get solving!**

This directory contains many files, each of which is a challenge card with instructions to solving the card and the difficulty level. If you take a challenge card, let your instructor know. If you finish solving the challenge card, email your final answer to your instructor or let them know in the class. You will have to show them the result for it to count. 

Good luck!
