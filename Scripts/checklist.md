## ✅ Manual Setup Checklist

If the installation script didn’t work on your computer — no worries! You can install everything manually.

This checklist will help you **make sure all the required tools are properly installed**. Go through it step by step, and tick off each item as you go.

### 🔟 You Should Have These Installed:

1. **Git**
   ➤ Open **Terminal** (macOS) or **PowerShell** (Windows) and type:

   ```bash
   git
   ```

   If it shows something other than “command not found,” you’re good!

2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
   ➤ Search for **Visual Studio Code** on your computer.
   If it opens, you’ve got it.

3. **Python 3.12**
   ➤ In Terminal or PowerShell, type:

   ```bash
   python
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python3
   ```

   You should see something like `Python 3.12.x`.

4. **VS Code Extensions**
   ➤ Open VS Code
   ➤ Click the **Extensions icon** on the left sidebar (looks like 4 squares)
   ➤ Make sure these are installed:

   * `Jupyter`
   * `Python`
   * `Serial Monitor`
   * `Pylance`

5. **Python Packages**
   ➤ In Terminal or PowerShell, type:

   ```bash
   pip show ipykernel
   pip show ipython
   ```

   If it shows details about the package, it’s installed.

6. **Cloned GitHub Repository**
   ➤ Check that the folder with the class files (from GitHub) is saved inside the **Documents** folder on your computer.

### 💡 Using a Different Operating System?

If you're not using Windows or macOS (like Linux or something else), you'll need to install these tools using that system’s package manager (like `apt`, `yum`, etc.).
